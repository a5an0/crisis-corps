  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>The Crisis Corp Facebook Application was created out of the
	  need to aggregate crowdsourcing resources for disaster relief
	  tasks, such as translation of SMS messages and digital map
	  enhancement. It is crucial to have a crowdsourcing network in
	  place prior to a disaster so that accomplishing Mechanical
	  Turk-like tasks requires only activation of the network, not
	  creation of it. </p>
  <p>The app is designed to take advantage of the
	  social aspects of Facebook in order to create a crowdsourcing
	  network of individuals, gathering and recording their skillset
	  and interest data to help qualify them as candidates for
	  working on whatever tasks and needs may arise. Crisis Corp is
	  not a Mechanical Turk application; we create the network of
	  people that are standing by for you to call into service with
	  your evaluation system. Organizations coordinating their
	  crowdsourcing efforts through Crisis Corp enhances the
	  credibility of the tool, and helps grow the social network of
	  users through merit based incentives setup by Crisis Corp and
	  granted by the organization.</p>
