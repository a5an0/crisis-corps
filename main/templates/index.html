	  <h2>Story - Haiti and OSM</h2>
	  <p>During the Haiti earthquake aftermath, users around the globe
		contributed their knowledge to the Open Street Maps project
		which helped to fill in knowledge gaps on maps of the effected
		area, enabling relief efforts to be better informed of their
		surroundings. Thousands of text messages were translated into
		languages that rescuers could understand, and lives were saved
		as a result. All of that work was done by individuals,
		sitting at their computer and volunteering their time and
		effort to make a difference. </p>
